<hr/>
<p>Northeastern University’s Progressive Student Alliance (PSA) has been fighting for social and economic justice for workers on campus and around the globe since 2008. While our organization primarily focuses on workers’ rights, we understand that all oppression is connected. PSA values <b>collective liberation </b>&#8211; we strive to build relationships with other grassroots movements because we believe the student-labor solidarity movement is part of a larger struggle for global justice. Whether supporting service workers on our campus or factory workers making Northeastern apparel around the world, PSA is committed to making real and tangible change.
