<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience…we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Dwight Eisenhower</span></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the dangerous influence of the military-industrial complex (MIC) extends even further than Eisenhower warned in 1961. It is not hard to see the “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exercising total control over the reckless, imperialist foreign policy of the U.S. But in an early draft of his famous speech, Eisenhower actually <a href="https://www.amazon.com/University-Chains-Confronting-Military-Industrial-Academic-Imagination/dp/1594514232">referred</a> to a </span><b>military-industrial-</b><b><i>academic </i></b><b>complex </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in which academic institutions supply research &amp; human capital to serve military-industrial purposes, enabling the concentration of global power into the hands of an unelected &amp; unaccountable few, fueling the violence and destruction of endless war. <strong>In the post-9/11 security/surveillance state, Northeastern has embraced a leading position in this deadly triangle. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeastern’s lucrative relationships with federal agencies &amp; private defense contractors have made this university complicit in the death &amp; suffering of Libyans, Syrians, Yemenis, Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghans… the list goes on. Selling out our university to military-industrial interests threatens our ability to have academic freedom, open dissent, and free speech. Northeastern’s integration into the military-industrial-academic complex has manifested in the following ways: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2012-2015, President Aoun </span><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/03/03/northeastern-president-joseph-aoun-named-department-homeland-security-academic-advisory-council/xKaId1uUYb2UIUjNuBsbVK/story.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">served</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a founding member of the </span><b>Homeland Security Academic Advisory Council</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group of 18 administrators &amp; academics tasked with bringing academic institutions in line with Department of Homeland Security objectives and making recommendations to the Security of Homeland Security.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeastern has received millions of dollars in </span><b>donations from Raytheon</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s largest producer of guided missiles &amp; fifth-largest defense contractor. In return, Raytheon executives have been </span><a href="http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=870418"><span style="font-weight: 400;">given seats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Northeastern’s highest governing bodies (Corporation &amp; Board of Overseers). Their company receives a guaranteed source of labor (hundreds of students have done </span><a href="http://huntnewsnu.com/2008/10/column-the-military-industrial-side-of-northeastern/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-ops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Raytheon &amp; they now employ almost 1,000 Northeastern alumni) and has its name on an auditorium (no, it’s really not an amphitheater).</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raytheon missiles have been used to commit war crimes, such as Israel’s 2006 </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2006/07/29/israel/lebanon-israel-responsible-qana-attack"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massacre in Qana, Lebanon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which killed 28 people including 16 children). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raytheon </span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/11/defense-contractors-laud-themselves-for-steering-candidates-toward-militarism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lobbies in favor of war</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &amp; celebrated </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/07/investing/syria-raytheon-tomahawk-missiles/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">booming stock prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Trump launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at Syria. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raytheon developed a microwave pain ray for the Department of Defense called the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Denial_System"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Active Denial System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was tested on prisoners in California.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raytheon is bidding for the contract to expand the </span><a href="http://cdn.defenseone.com/a/defenseone/interstitial.html?v=7.6.1&amp;rf=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.defenseone.com%2Fbusiness%2F2017%2F02%2Falmost-200-firms-have-bid-build-trumps-border-wall%2F135783%2F"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wall on the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeastern is the lead institution in the </span><a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/alert/"><b>ALERT program</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, established in 2008 with a $10M grant from the Department of Homeland Security. Ten industrial partners (including Raytheon) buy into the program to gain access to explosives-related research. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The College of Computer and Information Science has been </span><a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2012/05/cyber-operations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">designated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a National Security Agency (NSA) “Center of Excellence in Cyber Operations.” CCIS students take NSA-run seminars and temporary jobs, getting training for careers in government cybersecurity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occupies a satellite campus in Burlington, MA devoted to research in “arenas critical to national security.” George Kostas, a wealthy nationalistic alum, has made three donations totalling $16M, which has led to a huge influx of funding for security-related research from other sources, in what Northeastern calls </span><a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/magazine/the-kostas-effect/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the Kostas effect.”</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northeastern emphasizes “security” as one of three major research priorities; however, 15 years into the “war on terror,” Aoun &amp; the Board of Trustees are still broadcasting the lie that more invasive surveillance, deadlier weapons, &amp; increased academic collusion with the state can make us more secure. Aside from the information above, there is a great deal that Northeastern keeps secret about its relationships with military-industrial entities. Regardless, we can identify a concerted effort to cash in on the growing demand for military-industrial research and development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Militarization has made Northeastern a lot of money, and as long as it remains profitable, we can expect more of it. In other words, these programs’ future existence depends on never-ending global war &amp; conflict. It’s time for a radically different approach--one that does not devalue human life in pursuit of profits.</span></p>
