<hr/>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stigma around mental health and mental illness exists on a global scale, and college campuses are no exception. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and take the first steps toward seeking treatment and, for many college students, this is an incredibly important factor in maintaining safety and wellness. It is imperative that college students have access to mental health services that are competent, comprehensive, affordable, and timely. According to student reports, University Health and Counseling Services at Northeastern (UHCS) has often been unable to provide such necessary care for their students, and is not committed to putting the needs of students first. Students have reported that the counseling center does not have an adequate number of trained behavioral health clinicians (there are only nine for 18,000 undergraduate students), the existing counselors do not reflect the diversity of the student body, the center gives students long waiting periods between scheduling appointments, and often provides students with outdated referrals. The therapy system itself at UHCS is short-term care, meaning that students have a limited amount of appointments before they are given a referral to an outside organization or private practice that matches their insurance. This is not an atypical practice for university health centers, but the lack of accountability and available appointments makes UHCS particularly difficult to maneuver, especially for those who are already dealing with mental health-related stress. Students often leave their UHCS appointments feeling frustrated or dissatisfied with the services they have received. Many do not go on to find alternative treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the SMILE (Suicide and Mental Illness Education) is a student-led organization that works to close this gap between the services offered at UHCS and finding outside help in the Greater Boston community. Behind the SMILE is committed to deconstructing stigma surrounding mental health and providing a supportive educational environment that helps students to learn about mental illness and suicide prevention, particularly as it affects college students. We hold weekly meetings during which we engage in open group discussions about mental health related topics. The goal of these conversations is to provide a safe and comfortable space for students to give and receive support on these often difficult and personal topics. We have also run photo campaigns to raise awareness about mental health, and hosted Self-Care Sundays where students can gather to de-stress. We work with other like-minded student organizations to bring mental health conversations to light on our campus, and we support organizations whose missions are to encourage the safety and well-being of students who are struggling. We work closely with the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), and we bring an annual Out of the Darkness campus walk to Northeastern. This walk raises awareness of suicide prevention and raises money for AFSP, an organization whose mission is to understand and prevent suicide through research, education, and advocacy. Behind the SMILE is committed to supporting students who are struggling and advocated for better mental health resources on our campus and beyond.</span></p>
