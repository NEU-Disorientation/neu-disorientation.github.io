title: Feminist Student Organization

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fsoatneu/">Feminist Student Organization</a> is a student group committed to promoting discussion, debate, and action as it relates to feminism and its many intersections in society. While each of our members has their own way of describing what it means to be a feminist, FSO describes feminists as people dedicated to bringing about full equality, particularly in regards to gender and sex. FSO is a discussion-based group which also coordinates community outreach and programming, and which thrives on diverse opinions and lively discussion. Recently, FSO coordinated group transportation to D.C. for the Womenâ€™s March, and is planning events for the upcoming transgender week of awareness in November.</span></p>
