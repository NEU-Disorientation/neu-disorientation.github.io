<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, you’re sexually active…what now?</span></p>
<p><strong>GETTING TESTED</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you become or remain sexually active when you arrive at Northeastern, you should get tested for STIs/HIV regularly, especially since often STIs do not show outward  symptoms. Getting tested, however, can seem like a daunting task in a new environment: Where do you go? How do you pay? Fortunately, there are several clinics in Boston to choose from, as listed below:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk-in hours, no appointment necessary</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Whittier Street Health Center</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1290 Tremont Street</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, what do you do with these resources? The location you choose may be based on what and how you’re willing to pay for these services. If you have insurance, all insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act should cover certain preventative care procedures, including STI testing. There should be no co-pay or lab fees. However, if you have not gotten tested on your current insurance plan, it’s a good idea to call your insurance company to make sure your plan has rolled over to meet the ACA’s standards. Your insurance might not cover, or only cover a part of, your testing fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be many reasons why you might not feel comfortable using your insurance policy to get tested, especially if you are a dependent on your parents’ insurance and don’t want them to know. If you choose not to use your insurance or do not have insurance, don’t worry! Several of these places, like Fenway Health, offer testing free of charge; others, like Planned Parenthood, offer sliding-scale payment plans; UHCS offers self-pay testing that does not charge your insurance or send home a bill of services (for example, they charge $25 to test HIV, $25 to test chlamydia and gonorrhea, etc.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you get tested, remember to check the clinic’s website or call ahead for walk-in hours, appointment times, payment plans, etc.</span></p>
